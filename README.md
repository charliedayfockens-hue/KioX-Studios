## Who we are

**KioX Studios** is an independent game studio making lightweight games that run
right in the browser — no downloads, no installs, no app store. Everything is
built with plain **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** (plus a little WebGL) so a game is
always one tap away and works the same on iPhone, Android and desktop.

Our focus:

- **Mobile-first** — designed for touch and landscape phones before anything else.
- **Instant play** — open a link and you're in.
- **Self-contained** — no build steps and no fragile external dependencies, so
  the games keep working for years.
- **Feel over realism** — arcade handling that's fun in the first five seconds.

### 🏎️ KioX Drift

A 3D mobile drift game. Slide across wide low-poly tracks, lay down smoke and
skid marks, chase a bigger drift score in **Free Drift**, or race a skilled
drifting AI in **AI Race**.

**Controls**

- **Touch:** on-screen Gas, Brake / Reverse, Steer L / R and Handbrake (multi-touch).
- **Keyboard:** `W`/`↑` gas · `S`/`↓` brake/reverse · `A`/`←` left · `D`/`→` right · `Space` handbrake.

**Highlights**

- Two maps: **🌲 Forest** and **🏜️ Desert**, each with wide curvy tracks
  (straights, sweepers, S-curves and a hairpin) and their own scenery, sky and lighting
- Two modes: **Free Drift** (endless practice + drift score) and **AI Race**
  (2 laps vs a drifting AI, with a 3·2·1·GO countdown, lap counter, position and winner screen)
- Slippery arcade drift physics — long glides, big holdable angles, 360 spins,
  tire smoke and skid marks
- Custom car colour (presets + full colour picker), saved between sessions
- Polished mobile menu with an animated 3D car preview, fullscreen + landscape support
- A smooth 3D follow camera

## Tech

- **Rendering:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (WebGL), vendored locally so
  there's no CDN dependency to break.
- **Everything else:** vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript ES modules — no framework,
  no bundler, no build.
- **Audio:** procedural engine and tire sounds via the WebAudio API (no asset files).

## Hosting

The site is served with **GitHub Pages** straight from this repository, so the
game is live at:

**https://charliedayfockens-hue.github.io/KioX-Studios/**

Because everything uses relative paths and no build step, you can also just open
`index.html` locally in any modern browser to play offline.
